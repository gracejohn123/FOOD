### Project Description
go-to platform for discovering amazing deals on surplus food from local restaurants and stores. Not only can you enjoy delicious meals and quality products at discounted prices, but youâ€™re also contributing to reducing food waste and supporting a sustainableÂ future. Where Smart Choices MeetÂ GreatÂ Deals.

### The Problem 
In a world where approximately one-third of all food produced is wasted, millions of people face food insecurity daily, and businesses struggle to manage surplus inventory effectively. This contributes to environmental degradation, financial losses, and missed opportunities for community support. Despite growing awareness of sustainability, there is a lack of accessible, affordable, and rewarding platforms that bridge the gap between food waste reduction and consumer needs, leaving untapped potential for both local businesses and eco-consciousÂ individuals.

### The Solution 
Introducing Food, the hero we didnâ€™t know we needed. Imagine a world where every leftover biryani, extra loaf of garlic bread, or unsold box of brownies gets a second chance at happiness! With Food, weâ€™re turning food waste into foodieÂ treasureÂ hunts.
